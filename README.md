An easy Gradle plugin that follows [semver.org](http://semver.org/) rules to
automatically generate the _Patch_ version, _Build_ number and _Code_ version, while _Major_,
_Minor_ and _Pre-Release_ suffix remain under our control.

I saw plenty of plugins that require a long configuration and continuous adjustment just to update
those numbers, if so, better without any plugin then! With this plugin we are required to manage
only 2 variables.

Inspired from <a href='https://andreborud.com/android-studio-automatic-incremental-gradle-versioning/'>Android Studio
Automatic Incremental Gradle Versioning</a>. Customized into library with PreRelease, Auto-Reset and Sub-Modules features.</p>

> :speech_balloon: Easy to apply, it _works with **any** project type with sub modules too._

## Rules
###### User values
**major**: Required, user defined value for breaking changes.<br>
**minor**: Required, user defined value for new features, but backwards compatible. If you increase _Major_ version, this value must be coherent(=0).<br>
**patch**: Optional, user defined value (or auto-generated value) for backwards compatible bug fixes only.<br>
**preRelease**: Optional, user defined value for pre-releases suffix.<br>
**incrementOn**: Optional, custom task name to trigger the increase of the version (default: `assembleRelease`, `bundleRelease`, `grabverRelease`).<br>
**saveOn**: Optional, custom task name for which you want to save the versioning file (default: `build`, `assembleDebug`, `assembleRelease`, `bundleDebug`, `bundleRelease`, `grabverRelease`, `jar`, `war`, `explodedWar`).

###### Calculation
**patch** - If not specified by user, increases at each release, but it auto resets back to 0 when _Minor_ or _Major_ version changes or if _preRelease_ is set.<br>
**build** - Increases at each build.<br>
**code** - Increases at each release.

## Installation
Configure plugin management in _settings.gradle_ file: 
``` gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
    }
}
```

Configure build script in each _build.gradle_ file:
``` gradle
plugins {
    id "eu.davidea.grabver" version "2.0.3"
}
```

## Usage
### 1. Version configuration
Apply the plugin in the _module_ you desire, it will create a `version.properties` file under that module!
``` gradle
plugins {
    ...
    id 'eu.davidea.grabver'
}

versioning {
    // Required (number)
    major 1
    minor 0
    // Optional, force custom patch (number)
    patch 7
    // Optional (any string)
    preRelease "RC1"
    // Optional, custom task name to trigger the increase of the version
    incrementOn "<task-name>"
    // Optional, custom task name for which you want to save the versioning file
    saveOn "<task-name>"
}
```
> :speech_balloon: **Note:** The file `version.properties` is auto-generated, but once it's created, you can modify its content
as of your convenience. Just remember to add it to your Version Control System (from time to time).

### 2. Grab your new version
``` gradle 
versioning.major
versioning.minor
versioning.patch
versioning.build
versioning.preRelease
versioning.code        // needed for all Android projects
versioning.name        // output: "major.minor.patch[-preRelease]"
versioning.fullName    // output: "major.minor.patch[-preRelease] #buildNr built on yyyy.MM.dd"
versioning.builtOn     // output: " built on yyyy.MM.dd"
versioning.date        // or versioning.getDate([format]) - default "yyyy.MM.dd"

// Example: grab the version name
version = versioning.name
```
> :warning: **Note:** To trigger the evaluation, user must grab one of the above attribute!

### 3. Run it
- Via command line:
```
/**
 * To increment build number only:
 * - Code and Patch remain unchanged
 */
gradle [build | jar | war | explodedWar | assembleDebug | bundleDebug]

/**
 * To increment build, patch and code:
 * Code and Patch are incremented because of releases:
 * - Code is incremented if exists a release task.
 *   Example: "bundleRelease", "grabverRelease", ":module:assembleRelease"
 * - But Patch may be resetted if Major or Minor is changed or if preRelease is set
 */
gradle [assembleRelease | bundleRelease | grabverRelease]
```
- In Android Studio:
  - via menu _build > Build Bundle / APK_ (bundleDebug | assembleDebug)
  - via menu _build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK_ (bundleRelease | assembleRelease).
  - by _running the App_ (assembleDebug | assembleRelease, depending by the build variant).

From [version 2](https://github.com/davideas/GrabVer/releases/tag/2.0.0), the plugin evaluates the run tasks
in silent mode to automatically skip the new version evaluation and to not print unnecessary logs _if_ no save task
was detected. A single warning line is however produced.<br>
Single tasks performed such as _clean, test, flyway_ and **all** third parties invented plugin
tasks out there will not trigger the versioning evaluation. Example:

|Command|Outcome|
|---|---|
|`gradle clean test`|Evaluation skipped|
|`gradle javadoc`|Evaluation skipped|
|`gradle flywayClean`|Evaluation skipped|
|`gradle clean build`|Evaluation triggered and new values saved|
|`gradle clean war grabverRelease`|Evaluation triggered, versioning increased and new values saved|

# Contributions
Everybody is welcome to improve existing solution.

> :speech_balloon: **Note:** Unit tests work fine if you open the project with IntelliJ Idea, while with Android Studio
they don't. Alternatively, you can simulate a real build script by running `gradle install`
and `gradle -b build-test.gradle [grabverRelease]` OR testing with modules `gradle build [grabverRelease]`.
